## Themes

These can be accessed the normal way you change themes, at the bottom of the main region with the theme name. (Usually `Skyblock` or `Skyblock Original`).

- Better New SB - An edit of the 2023/New theme that I personally prefer (also shows your inbox, details and alerts which aren't present by default).
- Dark Mode (Pink Accent) - a custom dark mode theme with a pink accent (only over the **old theme**).
- Custom ones & more to come soon.
